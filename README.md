# The Software Library

This repository is a collection of software sourced from the internet. Its goal is to provide a ready-to-use reference of tools for a wide range of project needs. Each section focuses on a specific topic, listing relevant tools along with useful information. The ðŸ‘‘ emoji highlights the most valuable or recommended software (in my opinion) for that subject. Have fun!
